2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_video_clock and clk_out1_video_clock_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_video_clock] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_video_clock_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_video_clock_1 and clk_out1_video_clock are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_video_clock_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_video_clock]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-36#1 Critical Warning
Invalid Generated Clock due to missing edge propagation  
There is no rising/falling edge propagation between master clock clk_out1_video_clock to generated clock rgb2dvi_m0/U0/SerialClk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-30#1 Warning
Sub-optimal master source pin selection for generated clock  
The generated clock rgb2dvi_m0/U0/SerialClk has a sub-optimal master source pin selection, timing can be pessimistic
Related violations: <none>

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-through : [get_pins -filter {NAME =~ *SyncAsync*/oSyncStages_reg[0]/D} -hier]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '2' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].
